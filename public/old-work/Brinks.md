Brinks, a name synonymous with secure money transfers, recently made a comeback in the home security sector. Facing a market crowded with tech startups, the weight of the Brinks name was invaluable. We capitalized on this by deconstructing their iconic logo to create a comprehensive design system. This system not only organized our information effectively but also conveyed a sense of extreme meticulousness and reliability. If Brinks were a person, their day would start with a perfectly made bedâ€”our design system aims to be that perfectly made bed, embodying the brand's unwavering commitment to precision.
