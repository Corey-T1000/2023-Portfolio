For the first time, IRConf brought together front-line DevOps and SRE practitioners for a half-day virtual conference for industry experts and new voices in incident response. Incident responders came together to swap horror stories about the biggest outages, discuss best practices, and gain a better understanding of how the best are dealing with incidents.
