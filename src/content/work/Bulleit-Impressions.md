Bulleit Frontier Works collaborates with contemporary artists. In this campaign, artists from NYC, Chicago, and Portland reimagined the iconic Bulleit bottle using its unique embossing. The artists added their own flair, resulting in unique artworks. We then partnered with Colossal Media for large-scale, outdoor displays of these creations.
