After the Trump administration slashed ACA advertising by 90%, we mobilized The Coverage Coalition. Leveraging national TV, Times Square billboards, and social media, the campaign reached 100 million people and drove record-breaking enrollments. Week-over-week, sign-ups consistently outperformed previous years.
