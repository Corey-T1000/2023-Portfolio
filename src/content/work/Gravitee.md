Gravitee is the first-ever event-native API Management solution that natively supports synchronous REST APIs, asynchronous APIs, and event brokers like Kafka and MQTT. Working with the in-house team at Gravitee we focused on creating a design system that can be used across all touch points from technical diagrams to casestudies. This is an ongoing project  and expansive project that will continue to grow as the company grows.
