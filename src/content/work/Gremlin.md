Gremlin is a platform for chaos engineering. It allows you to run experiments on your infrastructure to find weaknesses before they cause problems. While at Gremlin, I worked on a variety of projects including the website, product, and events. Working with the team at Studio Science we launched a brand new identity in 2022. The new identity work can be seen here.
