Little Caesars is known for its unconventional pizzas, and their social media engagement is no different. To introduce their innovative Pizza Portal, we created an illustrated 'How to Pizza Portal' guide. As Instagram stories gained popularity, so did Little Caesars' $5 Lunch Combo. To celebrate, we launched an Instagram 'arcade,' featuring a tap-based game that engaged users through a series of interactive stories, all while promoting their new $4 Lunch Combo.
